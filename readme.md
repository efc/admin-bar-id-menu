# Admin Bar ID Menu

Makes the ID number of the current page or post visible in the Admin Bar.

## Description

There are times that you need to know the ID number of a page or post in WordPress and it can be more painful than it should be to find that number. This plugin does one simple thing: it displays the ID number of the page, post, category, or tag you are looking at in the WordPress Admin Bar. It appends this ID to the edit menu already on the Admin Bar. Needless to say, that means that this plugin is only useful for WordPress version 3.1 or above, since the Admin Bar was first introduced with 3.1.

## Git vs. SVN

I am maintaining this plugin with git, but WordPress requires SVN for plugins. I am using the [wp-deploy](https://github.com/kasparsd/wp-deploy) scripts to deploy the SVN version.

Note that the WordPress readme file is (readme.txt)[readme.txt].

## Version Bumps

Please update the following files whenever you need to bump the version. Note, a version bump is essential to having changes in the stylesheet recognized by browsers in the wild.

* [admin-bar-id-menu.php](admin-bar-id-menu.php) (change the Version in the header, which is the usual WordPress thing to do)
* [changelog.md](changelog.md) (describe the changes in this version)
* [readme.txt](readme.txt) (update the Stable tag in the header, replace Changelog with most recent version info)
