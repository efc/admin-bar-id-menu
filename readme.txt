Makes the ID number of the current page or post visible in the Admin Bar.

== Description ==

There are times that you need to know the ID number of a page or post in WordPress and it can be more painful than it should be to find that number. This plugin does one simple thing: it displays the ID number of the page, post, category, or tag you are looking at in the WordPress Admin Bar. It appends this ID to the edit menu already on the Admin Bar. Needless to say, that means that this plugin is only useful for WordPress version 3.1 or above, since the Admin Bar was first introduced with 3.1.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `admin-bar-id-menu` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would anyone need this? =

If you are asking this question, you don't need this at all. The only time to bother with this plugin is after you've been frustrated a few times trying to track down an id.

= Why don't I see numbers on "view" items? =

The inclusion of id numbers on the "view" items in the Dashboard only works in WP 3.3 and up. If you are not seeing those numbers, then you may need to upgrade your WordPress installation.

== Screenshots ==

1. Notice the number next to the edit link in the Admin Bar, that is the page's ID number.

== Changelog ==

= 1.1 =
* no functional changes, just tested and moved to Github
